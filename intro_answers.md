**Lucas Freitas** - *CS171: Homework 1*

  1. The most evident feature lacking in this table is **interactivity** to let users sort the data easily based on maximum rate, minimum rate, state name, etc. One interesting improvement would be letting users click the top of different rows and **sort the data based on that row**. The sorting could be done by value for rows consisting of numerical values and by alphabetical order for rows containing strings. Moreover, clicking the top of row when that row is already selected could togle between sorting the row in ascending and descending order.
