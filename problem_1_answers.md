1. Analyze an HTML Data <table>
---

**Lucas Freitas** - *CS171: Homework 1*

  1. By using the <code>colspan="3"</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> node we make the first row of the table, which consists of only one column, align its left border to the left border of the first row of the table and its right border to the right border of the third. Since there are only 3 columns on the table, the first row occupies the entire width of the table.

  2. **CSS Attributes**
  	* <code>padding: 3px;</code>: adds 3px of padding around each <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element in the table, which makes the data look less cramped.
  	* <code><line-height: 1.22em;></code> changes the height of text lines, making text look shorter.
