**Lucas Freitas** - *CS171: Homework 1*

  1. By using the <code>colspan="3"</code> attribute on the <code>/<th/></code> node we make the first row of the table, which consists of only one column, align its left border to the left border of the first row of the table and its right border to the right border of the third. Since there are only 3 columns on the table, the first row occupies the entire width of the table.
