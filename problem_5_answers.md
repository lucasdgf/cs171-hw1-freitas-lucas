5. Interactive Horizontal Bar Chart

**Lucas Freitas** - *CS171: Homework 1*

1. The graph is missing many things that currently make it virtually unusable:
	* A title to let users know what the data is representing.
	* Captions for each of the bars to let users know what each of them is referring to.
	* Values for each of the bars or a general scale so that users know the actual value of each of the data points represented.
